# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn Jobs | 7/10 | simple and minimal (almost too minimal), Searching for jobs is easy but trying to find jobs in specific areas can be a little confusing. |
| Indeed | 7/10 | Feel too crowded on the home page when searching for jobs and makes it easy to search for job titles and locations |

The site is a little busy for a screen reader making it describe what is on the screen in an order that may be challenging for some to understand | 1.5 |  Keeping the page less busy and simpler will help the screen reader give a better description for those that use them. |
| **TOTAL** |   |   |
